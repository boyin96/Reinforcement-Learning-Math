Reinforcement Learning Math
==============================

Welcome to the documentation for **Reinforcement Learning Math**. This project focuses on providing detailed mathematical foundations and derivations in the field of reinforcement learning (RL), with an emphasis on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. The aim is to build a comprehensive and intuitive guide to understanding the theoretical underpinnings of RL algorithms.

Overview
-----------

Reinforcement learning is a powerful paradigm for decision-making and control tasks. It involves agents learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. To facilitate a deeper understanding, this documentation includes:

- A formal definition of commonly used mathematical symbols in reinforcement learning.
- Detailed derivations of key algorithms, starting with policy gradient methods in deep reinforcement learning.
